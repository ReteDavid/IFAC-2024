# IFAC-2024
A BlueROV2-based platform for underwater mapping experiments


To work with BlueROV2 and ROS+QGroundControl we used the following package found at:
https://github.com/patrickelectric/bluerov_ros_playground.git

<<TODO-things to do before staring the filter>>
Starting GoPRO stream:
	python publish_gopro.py

To launch filter and color detection use (it runs the filter using our bag files, but it can run directly with the ROV):
	roslaunch rov_tf_tree filter.launch
To start YOLO detection:
	rosrun recognition ros_recognition_yolo.py
Starting mapping graph:
	rosrun rov_tf_tree object_click_test.py
